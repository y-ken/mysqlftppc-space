* SPEC
This plugin implements white-space tokenizer. As of MySQL SQL syntax, you can
query in natural langauge mode or in boolean mode.

Both natural language mode and boolean mode use unicode internally, and
indexed by Unicode Normalization. The encoding conversion is done automatically.

If you compiled the plugin with ICU library, you can turn on the Unicode 
normalization supported by ICU library. To normalize in NFC, execute SQL like:
 SET global space_unicode_normalize = 'C'
You can set one of NONE, C, D, KC, KD (and FCD).

If you're using MySQL 5.1.28, please patch the source(mysql-5.1.28-rc.patch).
